Variables store values

Camelcase is how you name variables
camelCase, helpMe, whatElse

var yourVariableName = yourValue;

They can store any primitive type:
var name = "Susan";
var secretNumber = 73;
var isAdorable = truel 

Variables can be called for their stored value
var name = "Susan";
>"hello there " + name 
hello there Susan

var num = 37;
>num + 3 + 10 
50

We can also update existing variables
var name = "Yuki";
name = "Heather";
>name
Heather

You can also change the type of variable by updating it
var num = "fifty"
>num
fifty

num = 55;
>num
55

Null and Undefined 

Variables that are declared but not initialized are undefined
var name; 
var age;

null is "explicitily nothing"
var currentPlayer = "Kate";
currentPlayer = null; //no current player
